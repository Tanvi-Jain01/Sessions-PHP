### XAMPP
XAMPP is a popular software package that allows you to set up a local web server environment on your computer. It stands for "X" (cross-platform), "Apache" (web server), "MySQL" (database), "PHP" (scripting language), and "Perl" (programming language).

To run website on XAMPP, follow these steps:

### Install XAMPP: First, download XAMPP from the Apache Friends website (https://www.apachefriends.org/).

### Start XAMPP:

Once installed, open XAMPP control panel.
Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking the "Start" buttons next to them for running a web server and database.

### Create a Project Folder:

Create a new folder in the **"htdocs"** directory of your XAMPP installation. By default, this directory is located at `"C:\xampp\htdocs"` on Windows or `"/opt/lampp/htdocs/"` on Linux.
Place your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) inside this folder.

### Access Your Website:

Open your web browser and enter the following URL: "http://localhost/your-folder-name/home.html". Replace "your-folder-name" with the name of the folder you created in step 3 and "home.html" with the name of your main HTML file.
For example, if your main HTML file is "index.html" and your folder name is "my-website," the URL will be "http://localhost/my-website/index.html".

### Test Your Website:
Your website should now be running locally on your computer via XAMPP. You can test it in your browser, just like you would on a live web server.
Remember that while using XAMPP, your website is only accessible on your local machine. Other devices won't be able to access it over the internet. XAMPP is primarily meant for development and testing purposes.

Additionally, if your website uses server-side scripting languages like PHP, you'll need to place those files in the same folder as your HTML files, and XAMPP will automatically execute the PHP scripts when accessed through the browser.
